<div class="textblock"><p>The following sections provide additional UWB or system-level detail for API parameters that are described in the documentation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection1"></a>
Message ID</h1>
<p>The Message ID parameter is a convenient way for the system integrator to keep track of messages and associated responses.</p>
<p>The user typically specifies a unique Message ID for each REQUEST command sent to one or more local P4xx units. The P4xx will echo this Message ID in each of its responses. In addition, upon receipt of RANGE_INFO, DATA_INFO, and SCAN_INFO messages the Message ID in each of these messages will uniquely match the SEND_RANGE_REQUEST message used to generate these INFO packets.</p>
<p>Typically, Host software for data collection will increment Message ID between each RANGE_REQUEST and use the Message ID to help relate RANGE, DATA, and SCAN info to a particular RANGE_REQUEST, as well as to isolate or debug dropped Ethernet/UDP messages.</p>
<p>In Network Mode, the P4xx is responsible for transmitting messages and will use the same technique of sending a unique Message ID such that it is possible to track message flow through the network. However, in Network Mode this message counter is separate and independent from the Message ID used during the Ranging Mode.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection2"></a>
Pulse Integration Index (PII)</h1>
<p>This value determines the number of pulses used in each radio symbol or point is a waveform scan. Larger PII values result in a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with longer distance operation at the expense of slower ranging and data rates. All P4xx nodes must be pre-configured with identical PII values in order to establish communication and ranging.</p>
<p>The user configures the “power of 2” of the pulse integration value. For example, a configured value of PII=7 results in the transmitting node sending 128 pulses per symbol and the receiving node expecting 128 pulses per symbol. If the user needs distance more than ranging rate, then the PIIs of both transmitter and receiver can be reconfigured to PII=8, providing 2x the SNR in each symbol resulting in approximately 40% more distance in line-of-sight conditions. The ranging conversation time will roughly double with each increment of PII.</p>
<p>The entire range of PII values with consequential distances, data rates, and ranging measurement update times are provided in the <em>320-0317 P440 Data Sheet.</em></p>
<p>Range measurement duration is the stopwatch time from request packet start to response packet received. This does not include overhead due to communication and processing by the user Host computer between successive packet reception and transmissions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection3"></a>
Antenna Mode</h1>
<p>The P4xx supports two antenna ports, Port A and Port B. The port nearest the corner of the board is typically designated as the A port. By default, the P4xx uses the A port. The user can define which port is to be used for transmit and which is to be used for receive. It is possible to use the same antenna for both transmission and reception. <br  />
</p>
<p>A special antenna mode, Mode 128, is available to support automatic toggling of the default antenna port after each range response. This allows one or more Host-controlled P4xx nodes to iteratively measure distances to two antenna points connected to a responder, without requiring Host support for the responder.</p>
<p>This definition is specified in the following API messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>SET_CONFIG_REQUEST <br  />
</li>
<li>SEND_RANGE_REQUEST <br  />
</li>
<li>SEND_DATA_REQUEST <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table illustrates the values:</p>

<p> <b>Table B-1:</b> Antenna mode configuration settings for the P4xx</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that there is also a parameter which allows the user to define the orientation of the Broadspec antenna (i.e., define whether the antenna is pointed up or pointed down). (<a class="el" href="structrcm_configuration.html#a167341a01f4facbeb4215fa503ce83e7">rcmConfiguration::flags</a> bits [3:2]) This capability is of importance for those interested in centimeter-level accuracy, since a mismatched antenna pair will result in an error in bias of 4 cm. A pair of antennas is considered mismatched when one antenna is pointing up and the other is pointing down. Defining which direction the antenna is pointing allows the ranging algorithm to compensate for the difference and thereby avoid a 4 cm error.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection4"></a>
Code Channel</h1>
<p>RangeNet is provided with a large number of independent communications channels. These channels are independent in that operation on one channel will be not register or be interfered by transmissions on a different channel in any meaningful way. In short, these channels are orthogonal. The channels are defined using different pulse transmissions rates. For example, one code might transmit pulses at 10.00 MHz while a different channel will transmit at 10.01 MHz. While these differences are slight, when coupled with coherent pulse integration it is enough to maintain a very high degree of isolation between channels.</p>
<p>The channels have been divided into two sets: long codes and short codes. Long codes (codes 0-10) have a nominal pulse repetition rate of 100ns. Short codes (codes 16-75) have a nominal pulse repetition rate of 70ns. Like codes are orthogonal, but unlike code are not. When operating in a system one should either use short codes or long codes, otherwise there will be mutual interference.</p>
<p>Humatics recommends the use of short codes for two reasons. First, there are many more short codes. This increases system capacity and scalability. Second, short codes need less airtime in which to range. This increases both the update rate and system scalability. The only benefit offered by long code is that emission regulations allow them to transmit 0.9dB more power and thereby enjoy marginally better range performance. In most applications, this is of trivial value.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection5"></a>
Antenna Delay A &amp; B</h1>
<p>Typically, the user will want to measure the separation distance measurement to the antennas of the radios. P4xx units have been calibrated by default to presume a zero Antenna Delay when using the default Broadspec antennas with a simple 90-degree elbow SMA connector. If the SMA connector is not used (i.e., the Broadspec antenna is attached directly to the P4xx antenna) then the user should substitute the value of 0 with a value of -91). In any event this effect is minor as removing the SMA connector increases the bias by about 25 mm or 1 inch.</p>
<p>If the system integrator changes to a new UWB antenna or uses a SMA coaxial cable extension, (for instance to keep the P4xx inside an electronics box with the antenna outside) then the range value reported would increase proportional to this extended TOF. The user can either consistently subtract the extra bias in his software or reconfigure the P4xx (using the SET_CONFIG_REQUEST) to store this bias using these registers.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection6"></a>
Timestamp</h1>
<p>Time stamp is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the latest P4xx power-up. This parameter is not used by the P4xx, but is provided to enable the system integrator to establish when the range was collected or data was received.</p>
<p>Note this is an interrupt-driven CMOS timestamp with millisecond accuracy. It is not based on picosecond timing triggers in the RF front end.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection7"></a>
Vpeak, Noise, SNR</h1>
<p>Vpeak and Noise are signal quality metrics that can be used to compute the received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These measurements do not require a full range conversation and are produced whenever the P4xx receives a range, data, or scan message packet.</p>
<p>Vpeak is a scaled value of the absolute value of the largest magnitude signal within a few nanoseconds of the leading edge of the waveform scan. This scaling is based on the PII as follows: Vpeak*(2^PII)/512.</p>
<p>Noise is a scaled estimate of the energy present prior to the leading edge. It is scaled by the same factor: Noise * (2^PII)/512. <br  />
</p>
<p>SNR can be computed from these values using the following equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>SNR= 20*Log10(Vpeak/Noise)</li>
</ul>
<p>Signal and Noise are imperfect but adequate for estimating the SNR. While both estimates are close, neither estimate is exact. Consequently, the measure of SNR is close, but not exact.</p>
<p>Signal and Noise are imperfect estimates in the following senses.</p>
<p>First, SNR is computed from the scan measured during waveform generation after the receiver has acquired lock. Given that, the SNR reported is not the SNR the radio sees when it acquires, but rather the SNR it sees during waveform scan. Also, the peak is the largest measured signal withing a few nanoseconds of the Leading edge rather than the largest signal present. These two values can differ depending on the radio lock point. (To illustrate this, set up a radio link in a multipath environment and observe the maximum signal as a function of lock point.)</p>
<p>Second, the user has the ability to use an FFT to reduce the noise in a measured scan and thereby increase the SNR by about 6 dB. Doing so will improve the accuracy and robustness of the reported range measurement. Therefore, the default setting is FFT on. However, the user can override this setting and not use the FFT. Note that the FFT is performed after the scan has been captured and does not have any effect on acquisition.</p>
<p>Third, while this capability is an improvement for range measurement, SNR is also frequently used as a metric to predict the operational range of the system. Since the SNR improvement applies only to the scan and not operational range, this could lead to confusion. An imperfect solution has been provided to avoid this confusion. While the waveforms (scans) and Vpeak are reported with the benefit of the FFT, the noise value reported has been reduced by an estimate of the benefit normally seen by the FFT. As a result, the value of SNR calculated from the Vpeak and Noise values will be approximately the same (within a dB) regardless of whether or not the FFT is used.</p>
<p>Fourth, noise is also imperfect in that it has been estimated based on an approximation technique rather than on the computation of standard deviation.</p>
<p>As a practical matter SNR computed from Signal and Noise has proved to be a useful and repeatable, if slightly inaccurate, tool for describing radio performance.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection8"></a>
Range Measurement Details</h1>
<p>A Two Way Time of Flight range measurement is distance between the requesting and responding P4xxs. More accurately it is a measure of the distance from a specific point on the antenna of the unit requesting a range measurement and the same point on the responder’s antenna. This point is called the antenna phase center and is illustrated below in <b>Figure B.1.</b></p>
<p>The units have been calibrated such that the distance between antenna phase centers should be within 1 cm of a value measured using a tape measure or laser range finder. However, there are a few caveats with this statement. <br  />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The P4xx must use the standard antenna provided by Humatics. Use of other antennas or intervening cables will cause a change. <br  />
</li>
<li>The units must be so close to each other that the transmitted signal overwhelms the receiver input. This is caused saturation. In saturation you can expect the difference between the actual distance and the reported distance will be off by a few cm. Generally, this issue will disappear if the units are separated by a few meters. See the relevant P4xx data sheet for details. <br  />
</li>
<li>The calibration assumes that the antennas are connected to the P4xx with a 90degree right angle connector. If the antenna is connected directly to the P4xx then the reported range measurement will be long. This bias can be removed by adjusting the antenna delay values. <br  />
</li>
<li>The calibration requires that both antennas be orientated in the same direction. If one is pointing up and the other is down, then this difference will introduce a 4cm error. This error can be avoided using the antenna direction parameter in the configuration message to indicate direction.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="subsystemsection9"></a>
Waveform Scan, Scan Data, Lock Spot, and Leading Edge</h1>
<p>These parameters are all associated with the waveform scan reported by the SCAN_INFO message, the computation of the leadings edge and the range estimation process.</p>
<p><b>Scan Data:</b> Once the receiver has acquired lock to the transmitted signal, it will measure the signal strength of the received signal such that it is possible to produce a plot of the received waveform as a function of time. This plotted signal is called a waveform scan, or a scan or a waveform. The waveform is reported by the SCAN_INFO message and is effectively an array of 1632 data points. The time resolution of the waveform points is 61 ps, so the overall waveform will be approximately 100ns. <br  />
</p>
<p><b>Lock Spot Offset:</b> In order for the P4xx to compute an accurate TOF, it must acquire or lock to a specific point in the received signal. This point is called the Lock Spot and it is the zero crossing closest to the maximum signal found by the receiver. Note this point might not be the strongest point in the received pulse or it might even be a point on a strong multipath signal which arrived substantially after the first arriving pulse. The lock spot is reported as an index into the 1632 scan data array. The waveform will have 90ns of measurements before the lock spot and 10ns afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Leading Edge Offset:</b> The P4xx leading edge detection algorithm will determine the time at which the first arriving energy from the transmitted pulse has arrived. This point is called the Leading Edge and it is reported as an index into the 1632 scan array.</p>
<p>These are illustrated in the <b>Figure B-2.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Fig. B-2:</b> Waveform scan showing Leading Edge (leading edge offset) and Lockspot (lockspot offset) </p>
<p>It is not necessary to use the SCAN_INFO API. This capability has been provided to allow the user to investigate the channel impulse response around the direct path and make conclusions about the range or channel multipath content.</p>
